This repository contains the data and code used in the paper titled "Market Power and Competition of Agricultural Industrial Organization: A Marshall Conflict Lens."  Specifically, this repository includes:

    A STATA dataset data.dta and the corresponding dofile code.do.

    An Excel dataset R.xlsx and the corresponding R script r.R.

In particular, we used R software for the mechanism analysis because the required DDL model cannot currently be implemented in STATA.
